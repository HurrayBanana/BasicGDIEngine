# BasicGDIEngine
A simple managed flexible sprite engine using GDI windows calls written in C#, easily adaptable

Shows the basic of rendering dynamic items through windows GDI

Shows how to define different types of sprite, text based, image based and line based

Could be used as the basis of a simple game engine or other realtime rendering system for things like silumations etc...

limitations:

1) needs a better timer system to control the gameloop, but may be adequate
2) maybe needs to be double buffered, depends on how much is being drawn
